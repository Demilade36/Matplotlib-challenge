# Matplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Matplotlib assignment submission for Data Analytics Bootcamp - UoT SCS
# Overview
This analysis was conducted using two CSV files: **Mouse MetaData** and **Study Results**.

- **Mouse MetaData:** Contains details of 250 mice showing Mouse ID, Drug Regimen, Sex, Age_months, Weight (g). 
- **Study Results:** Contains details of 1,894 study results showing Mouse ID, Timepoint, Tumor Volume (mm3), Metastatic Sites.

Using Pandas to read both csv files and merge them into a complete dataset, the following were performed using Matplotlib and presented using charts/graph.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): **Bar & Pie Charts and Box Plots**
- Tumor Volume Analysis for Capomulin: **Line Plot and Scatter Plot**
- Correlation & Regression Analysis: **Linear Regression model**
